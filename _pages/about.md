I am currently with the **School of Computer Engineering, Jiangsu Ocean University**, and received my Ph.D. from **Yamaguchi University, Japan**.

My research interests span **Petri Nets**, **multi-modal knowledge inference**, **expert systems**, and **information processing of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**. Specifically, my work focuses on: **knowledge-guided and constraint-aware AI models** for TCM diagnosis and treatment recommendation; **multimodal data fusion** integrating tongue images, inquiry text, pulse signals, and physiological indicators; **dynamic modeling and simulation of acupuncture mechanisms** using Colored Petri Nets and time-series analysis; and **explainable reasoning under domain constraints**, bridging data-driven learning with symbolic medical knowledge.
